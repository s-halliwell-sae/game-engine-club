Lua
Has it's own special build needs since we recommend luajit
http://luajit.org/install.html

Once built, the third-party property sheet may need to be configured for its folders. We currently have luaJIT-2.0.3\src added to the c++ include dir and lib dir. And lua51.lib added to input libraries.

The dll, eg lua51.dll will need to be placed next to any and all exes. Currently this is handled by a build post step that copies this file to bin for you

https://github.com/shines77/jemalloc-win32
Will need to be built. Property sheet looks for headers (third-party\jemalloc-win32-master\include) and libs (third-party\jemalloc-win32-master\lib\vc2013\x86)

sdl 2.0
https://buildbot.libsdl.org/sdl-builds/sdl-visualstudio/?C=M;O=D
We have version 2522 in a folder called sdl, this is then included, libs link and dll copied via the general gec property sheet.
